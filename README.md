# Entity Framework Designer

## Entity Framework visual design surface and code-first code generation for EF6, EFCore and beyond.

Model and generate code for Entity Framework v6, Entity Framework Core 2.0 and 2.1

**[Install with NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions) from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michaelsawczyn.EFDesigner)**

This Visual Studio 2017 extension adds a new file type (.efmodel) that allows for fast, easy and, most
importantly, **visual** design of persistent classes. Inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional 
associations are all supported. Enumerations are also included in the visual model, as is the 
ability to add text blocks to explain potentially arcane parts of your design.

While giving you complete control over how the code is generated you'll be able to, out of the box,
create sophisticated, consistent and **correct** Entity Framework code that can be regenerated when 
your model changes. And, since the code is written using partial classes, any changes you make
to your generated code are retained across subsequent generations.

If you are used to the EF visual modeling that comes with Visual Studio, you'll be pretty much at home.
The goal was to duplicate at least those features and, in addition, 
add all the little things that *should* have been there. Things like: 
- the ability to show and hide parts of the model
- easy customization of generated output
- class and enumeration nodes that can be colored to visually group the model
- different concerns being generated into different subdirectories (entities, enums, dbcontext)
- entities by default generated as partial classes so the default code can be easily modified
- string length, index flags, required attributes and other properties being available in the designer

and many other nice-to-have bits.

Code generation is completely customizable via T4 templates. The tool installs templates that 
target both EF6 and EFCore, and generate both a code-first DbContext class and 
POCO entity classes. The EF6 template's DbContext code is written to allow consumption in 
ASP.Net Core in addition to any other project type, so you'll have flexibility in your development.

You can read more about how to use the designer in the [Documentation site](https://msawczyn.github.io/EFDesigner/).

 ### Change Log

***1.2.6.2***
   - Added XML docs to DbContext, DatabaseInitializer and DbMigrationsConfiguration
   - Enabled drag and drop reordering of enum values and class properties
   - Gave some color to the enum value glyph in the model explorer - it was so boring!
   - Class properties and enum values with warnings now show a warning icon on the design surface
   - Design surface has a property to turn on or off the display of the warning icons 
   - Recategorized a few "Misc" properties on the design surface

**1.2.5.1**
   - Addressed [issue #20 - Abstract/inherited/TPC code still there for abstract class](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/20). While the discussion centered around abstract classes and TPC inheritance (which was behaving properly), it did uncover a problem with code generation when namespaces changed from class to class. 
     
<details>
<summary><b>1.2.5.0</b></summary>

   - Fix for [issue #19 - Recognize "Id" as primary key on import](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/19)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>1.2.4.0</b></summary>

   - Retargeted immediate error and warning messages to Visual Studio output window rather than error window so they could be cleared
   - Added drag validation to Generalization (inheritance) tool
   - Automatically propagate enum name and value name changes to classes that use them

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>1.2.3.3</b></summary>

   - Reverted the selection of the node in the model explorer when an element is selected in the diagram. Was causing bad user experience.
   - Fix for bad code generation when a class has multiple properties that each have an darabase index specified.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>1.2.3.0</b></summary>

   - When element selected in model explorer, no longer highlights in orange but instead selects, centers and zooms the element.
     This was done because the color change flagged the model as modified, making the user either undo or save the changes to keep
     source control happy.
   - Selecting an element in the diagram also selects it in the model explorer
   - Fix for [issue #12 - Cascade delete](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Added another enum value for delete behavior (now is Cascade, None and Default)
     and changed code generation to force no cascade delete if set to 'None' ('None' used to mean 'Use the default behavior', which is now, more explicitly, the 'Default'
     option).
   - Fix for [issue #13 - Unique index not generated in EF6](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/13).
   - Fix for [issue #14 - Table with two Primary keys not generated properly in context](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Many thanks to @Falthazar!
   - Fix for [issue #18 - Adds ValueGeneratedNever if identity type is Manual](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/pull/18). Again, hats off to @Falthazar!
